The **User** section of the Tina Cloud dashboard allows external users to be invited to the Tina Cloud dashboard and grants them authorization to edit directly on a Tina configured site.

> When a site is configured to use Tina Cloud, an authorized user will be prompted for their Tina Cloud credentials to access the editing route of the site.

## Admins vs Editors

When creating a new user in the dashboard, the permission section will require a role selection for the user.

There are currently two roles for Tina Cloud users:

### Admin

An **Admin** has complete access to the Tina Cloud dashboard. This user can add, edit and delete Tina Cloud projects. This user can also setup additional user accounts or edit existing user accounts.

### Editor

An **Editor** can login to the Tina Cloud dashboard, but is only authorized to view the sites that are configured and navigate to them.

Both Admins and Editors are authorized to access the editing route on a Tina configured site. Both users can save content changes directly to a site's GitHub repository using TinaCMS.
